# Cosmic Resume Portfolio

A cinematic, ASCII-driven developer resume built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and a custom cosmic animation widget.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Responsive resume layout** with a toggleable sidebar that houses project, education, skills, and contact links.
- **Lazy-loaded cosmic ASCII widget** that renders calm, hardware-accelerated animations and adapts to mobile/desktop viewports.
- **Interactive/auto playback controls** for cycling through 200+ cosmic entities with reduced ambient noise for clarity.
- **Downloadable PDF resume button** and accessible navigation with ARIA labels across the UI.
- **Performance optimizations** including GPU acceleration, reduced-motion support, and constrained repaint regions.

## üß± Tech Stack

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) + React 18
- Tailwind CSS with custom layers/utilities for animation
- `react-icons`/`lucide-react` for iconography
- Custom animation engine (`components/cosmic-ascii-scene.tsx`) with entity data in `data/cosmic-entities.json`

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install   # or npm install / yarn install
pnpm dev       # starts next dev server on http://localhost:3000
pnpm build     # production build
pnpm start     # run the built output
```

Place your PDF resume in `/public/Latest_Resume_01.pdf` (existing file name) to keep the download button working.
